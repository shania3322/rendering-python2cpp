# Learning c++ as a Python programmer

I picked up a [renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) project to
learn c++. The reason I picked this project is that c++ is the primary
programming language when it comes to computer graphics.

# How do I use the material

I will program in Python first, then rewrite it in c++.

# Progress
- ~~lesson 1: Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm~~
- lesson 2: Triangle rasterization and back face culling
