# My second c++ project

I made a simple ray-tracing in my first c++ project. (check out [simple ray-tracing](https://github.com/shania3322/raytracing_mini))

In the second project, I will be doing a small renderer following the tutorial
[renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki). When I started the
project, I wrote Bersenhan's Line Drawing Algorithm in Python. It was okay but I
could see there will be a performance issue very soon in the future. I stopped and
restarted the project after I finished my first c++ project. And this time, I
will use c++ and SDL as the rendering media. ( The original tutorial uses an
image class to control rendering.)
